# flms

An easy way to track the movies you watch. There's no login, no social buttons, no useless movie information, no database. You just write down the movies in a text file, the way you prefer it (eg. you could call *The Matrix* just *Matrix*.)

Detailed information on installation and usage, plus a list of who's already using it, you find on [our informative and extremely well written wiki page](https://github.com/seufelipe/flms/wiki).
